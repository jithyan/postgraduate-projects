      <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following includes information that may be useful in understanding the present disclosure. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art nor material to the presently described or claimed inventions, nor that any publication or document that is specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p>
      <heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the field of closure caps, seals or plugs for connectors or open ends of tubes of existing art and more specifically relates to medical fluid and vascular access line couplings.</p>
      <heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
      <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many patients need intravenous lines inserted when visiting the emergency room or have been admitted into the hospital for treatment. Others may need intravenous treatment on an outpatient basis. In either case, often patients are required to keep an intravenous line in place over a period of days. In an outpatient situation, patients need to maintain their personal hygiene by showering, bathing and the like, resulting in the intravenous line and connector being exposed to various contaminating fluids from these activities. When a patient is in an emergency room or hospital setting, intravenous lines may remain in place for extended periods due to varying perspectives on the frequency at which they should be changed. Within the medical community, there is currently lack of agreement as to when an intravenous line and needleless connectors should ideally be replaced to avoid contamination to a patient. It is very important to patient health that the intravenous line remain sanitary to remove or minimize the risk of a secondary infection. Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) are caused by contaminants such as air, liquid, micro-organisms and other biological materials entering the system. After contaminants have entered the system, patients are at significant risk for infection, sepsis, organ failure, and death. Hospitals incur increased costs and are required to report such incidents. An effective method of prevention of these types of infections is needed.</p>
      <p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,230,706 to Duquette relates to a bi-directional valve assembly used in needleless injection or infusion ports. The described bi-directional valve assembly used in needleless injection or infusion ports includes a bi-directional valve assembly disposed within an infusion system to permit the administration of an infusion solution without the use of a needle. The bi-directional valve assembly is a two-way spring valve which comprises: a spring means, a valve port, and a valve plunger having a sealing means and a conduit means disposed thereabout, wherein the spring means is connected to the valve plunger in such a way as to permit the opening of the conduit means when the spring means is recoiled such that the sealing means is not in contact with the valve port and to permit the closing of the conduit means when the spring means is expanded such that the sealing means is in contact with the valve port; whereby the bi-directional valve assembly is capable of opening and closing the infusion system.</p>
      <heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the art of medical fluid and vascular access line couplings, the present disclosure provides a novel system for enhanced sealing of coupled medical fluid and vascular access lines and method. The general purpose of the present disclosure, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide an improved system to seal-coupled medical fluid and vascular access lines at exposed connection sites such as male Luer lock connections, and method of use thereof. The improved system may maintain a sterile system over time, and thereby reduce rates of infection in patients requiring extended use of intravenous lines as part of treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-0008" num="0007">A system for enhanced sealing of coupled medical fluid and vascular access lines and method is disclosed herein. The system for enhanced sealing of coupled medical fluid lines includes a male fitting, a female fitting, and an annular collar seal.

      <p id="p-0019" num="0018">The various embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings, wherein like designations denote like elements.</p>
      <heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-0020" num="0019">As discussed above, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to medical fluid and vascular access line couplings, and more particularly to a system for enhanced sealing of coupled medical fluid and vascular access lines and method, as used to improve sealing of coupled medical fluid and vascular access lines to maintain a sterile connection. A sterile connection is critical in preventing Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) and other blood stream infections in patients requiring intravenous connections or use of any vascular access devices for extended periods. Vascular access devices are generally defined as tubing inserted into peripheral or central vessels, used primarily to administer fluids and medications, monitor pressures, and collect blood. Likewise, central lines are generally defined as intravenous lines that are inserted into large veins typically located in the neck or near the heart for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, for example to administer medicines or fluids, or to withdraw blood. These lines inserted into larger vessels are particularly helpful in achieving faster rates of infusion of fluids or medication in emergency or intensive care settings.</p>
      <p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, the present disclosure provides for an improved seal for central lines and other intravenous connections to prevent air, liquid, micro-organisms, and other contaminants from entering the blood stream. It creates an air tight, liquid proof seal around any threaded medical device compatible with Luer locks, requiring a sterile connection. The seal will assist in reducing infections, and therefore hospital admission days, CLABSIs, other reportable incidents, and most importantly mortality rates will decrease. It prevents everyday contaminants, such as shower water, emesis, urine, and stool from entering the bloodstream at exposed connection points. The present disclosure provides for improved sealing to maintain a sterile connection in central line and other medical devices connected to the blood stream in any location where male Luer lock fittings are used.</p>
      <p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present disclosure may be used with male Luer lock fittings to connect a wide variety of vascular access devices to a hub. The hub typically has a female end having a threaded or lug style locking element which is compatible to connect with the threaded collar of a male Luer lock extending from any vascular access device connected to a patient. Hubs may connect to dialysis catheters, central lines, intravenous lines, and any device which accesses a patient's venous system. If no intravenous fluid is required, the end of the catheter or central line hub may be capped off with a needleless connector utilizing the present disclosure. If an intravenous line is connected to a patient and no intravenous therapy is desired at the present time, the male Luer lock located at the end of the intravenous line may be sealed and a cap may be used with the present disclosure until further therapy is required. In other instances, the present disclosure may be used in conjunction with a needleless connector with a female end having a threaded or lug style locking element which is compatible to connect with the threaded collar of a male Luer lock.</p>
      <p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure may be fabricated for compatibility with current standards and requirements set forth by the International Standards Organization. ISO 594 is currently in use, however ISO 80369-7 will supersede ISO 594 for medical equipment. The standard consists of eight separate tests as follows: 1 Gauging: A dimensional check is performed using a calibrated plug gauge; 2 Liquid Leakage: Ensures that the sample Luer does not leak when pressurized with water; 3 Air Leakage: Ensures that the sample Luer does not leak when a vacuum pressure is applied; 4 Separation Force: Ensures that the sample Luer remains attached to the reference fitting when an axial load is applied; 5 Ease of Assembly: Ensures that the sample Luer can be assembled with minimum axial force and torque; 6 Unscrewing Torque: Ensures that the sample Luer remains attached under a specific unscrewing (counter-clockwise) torque; 7 Resistance to Overriding: Ensures that the threads cannot be overridden by a specific screwing (clockwise) torque; 8 Stress Cracking: Ensures that the sample Luer does not crack when assembled for 48 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-0024" num="0023">A color coding system may be used with the present disclosure in conjunction with colored intravenous lines for example, to identify various intravenous administrations for a given patient. More specifically, the annular collar seal may be color matched to tinted intravenous lines or other connectors to further assist with distinguishing between differing medications supplied to a patient, as one example.</p>
      <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Biocompatibility requirements for medical components are becoming increasingly stringent in order to prevent patient rejection, infection, and adverse effects such as allergic reactions. Vascular access devices (VADs) are one category of medical components which includes various types of devices which are inserted into veins via peripheral or central blood vessels for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons, such as blood sampling, administration of medication or fluids, and blood transfusions. To avoid the above mentioned concerns with vascular access devices, they are overwhelmingly fabricated from medical grade polymers. Medical grade as used herein is defined as a material, in this instance a polymeric material, which has been tested for biocompatibility and deemed appropriate to be used for medical applications. Medical grade polymers are specifically designed to be used in, on or in contact with the body. All raw materials, intermediate products, and finished products for medical grade use are manufactured with appropriate regulatory standards and in high enough purity such it can be used for medical purposes safely in patients.</p>
      <p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition to use of medical grade polymers, all medical devices used in intravenous therapy require thorough sterilization. Sterilization involves using chemicals, temperature, gas and/or pressure to kill or inactivate all disease-causing bacteria, spores, fungi and viruses. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes three categories of sterilization methods currently used to sterilize medical devices in manufacturing settings: Traditional, Non-traditional, and Novel Non-traditional. Examples of each are illustrated in Table 1 below.</p>

      <p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some traditional sterilization methods have been found to be unsuitable for medical products as these products cannot support high temperature sterilization processes. An alternative, often used process for sterilization utilizes Ethylene Oxide (EtO) gas with elevated temperature and humidity. This has become the preferred method for many medical products due to its relatively low processing temperatures of nominally 118 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity of approximately 65%. Materials selected for the system for enhanced sealing of coupled medical fluid lines, including those for the annular collar seal of the system should be done so with emphasis on corrugate strength and chemical stability over time to ensure compatibility with the sterilization procedures of Table 1, as well as any future processes developed for sterilization of medical products.</p>
