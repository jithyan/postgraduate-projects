      <heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-0002" num="0001">There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable soybean variety. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possess the traits to meet the program goals. The breeder's goal is to combine in a single variety an improved combination of desirable traits. These traits may include higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, reducing the time to crop maturity, tolerance to drought and/or heat, altered fatty acid profiles, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-0003" num="0002">These product development processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made until the finished seed is delivered to the farmer for planting. Therefore, development of new varieties is a time-consuming process that requires precise planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.</p>
      <p id="p-0004" num="0003">A continuing goal of soybean breeders is to develop stable, high yielding soybean varieties that are agronomically sound with maximal yield over one or more different conditions and environments.</p>

      <heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain definitions used in the specification are provided below. Also, in the examples and tables which follow, a number of terms are used. In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, the following definitions are provided:</p>
      <p id="p-0007" num="0006">AERBLT=AWB=AERIAL WEB BLIGHT. Aerial web blight is caused by the fungus <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, which can also cause seedling blight and root rot of soybeans. Stems, flowers, pods, petioles, and leaves are susceptible to formation of lesions. Tolerance to Aerial Web Blight is rated on a scale of 1 to 9, relative to known checks, with a score of 1 being susceptible, and a score of 9 being tolerant. Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>
      <p id="p-0008" num="0007">ALLELE. Any of one or more alternative forms of a genetic sequence. In a diploid cell or organism, the two alleles of a given sequence typically occupy corresponding loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes.</p>
      <p id="p-0009" num="0008">ANTHESIS. The time of a flower's opening.</p>
      <p id="p-0010" num="0009">ANTHRACNOSE. Anthracnose is a fungal disease commonly caused by <i>Colletotrichum truncatum</i>, and in some cases other <i>Colletotrichum </i>species may be involved. The fungus produces crowded, black acervuli on infected tissues. These dark bodies typically look like pin cushions on the tissue surface when viewed under magnification. The most common symptoms are brown, irregularly shaped spots on stem, pods and petioles. Resistance is visually scored on a range from 1 to 9 comparing all genotypes in a given experiment. A score of 9 indicates that there is no infection (resistance). Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>
      <p id="p-0011" num="0010">APHID ANTIBIOSIS. Aphid antibiosis is the ability of a variety to reduce the survival, growth, or reproduction of aphids that feed on it. Screening scores are based on the ability of the plant to decrease the rate of aphid reproduction. Plants are compared to resistant and susceptible check plants grown in the same experiment. Scores of 1=susceptible, 3=below average, 5=average, 7=above average, and 9=exceptional tolerance. Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>
      <p id="p-0012" num="0011">APHID ANTIXENOSIS. Aphid antixenosis is a property of a variety to reduce the feeding of aphids upon the plant, this is also known as nonpreference. Screening scores are based on the ability of the plant to decrease the rate of aphid reproduction. Plants are compared to resistant and susceptible check plants grown in the same experiment. Scores of 1=susceptible plants covered with aphids, plants may show severe damage such as stunting and/or necrosis, equivalent or worse when compared to susceptible check, 3=below average, plants show major damage such as stunting and/or foliar necrosis, 5=moderately susceptible, 7=above average, about 50 aphids on the plant, plant does not exhibit signs of plant stress, and 9=exceptional tolerance, very few aphids on the plant, equivalent or better when compared to a resistant check. Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>
      <p id="p-0013" num="0012">BACKCROSSING. Process in which a breeder crosses a donor parent variety possessing a desired trait or traits to a recurrent parent variety (which is agronomically superior but lacks the desired level or presence of one or more traits) and then crosses the resultant progeny back to the recurrent parent one or more times. Backcrossing can be used to introduce one or more desired traits from one genetic background into another background that is lacking the desired traits.</p>
      <p id="p-0014" num="0013">BLUP=BEST LINEAR UNBIASED PREDICTION. The BLUP values are determined from a mixed model analysis of variety performance observations at various locations and replications.</p>
      <p id="p-0015" num="0014">BREEDING. The genetic manipulation of living organisms, including application of one or more agricultural and/or biotechnological tools, methods and/or processes to create useful new distinct varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-0016" num="0015">BU/A=Bushels per Acre. The seed yield in bushels/acre is the actual yield of the grain at harvest.</p>
      <p id="p-0017" num="0016">BROWN STEM ROT=BSR=Brown Stem Rot Tolerance. This is a visual disease score from 1 to 9 comparing all genotypes in a given test.

Southern root knot nematode, <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>, is a plant parasite that can cause major damage to roots, reducing yield potential. Severity is visually scored on roots in a range from 1 to 9 comparing all genotypes in a given experiment to known resistant and susceptible checks. The score is determined by visually scoring the roots for presence or absence of galling in a controlled chamber bioassay. A score of 1 indicates severe galling of the root system which can cause premature death from decomposition of the root system (susceptible). A score of 9 indicates that there is little to no galling of the roots (resistant). Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>

Viral infection in soybean can cause stunting of plants as well as crinkling and mottling of leaves. Leaf blades can be puckered along the veins and curled downward. Mottling appears as light and dark green patches on leaves. SMV can also reduce seed size and/or pod number per plant, as well as contributing to seed discoloration associated with the hilum. Tolerance to SMV is rated visually on a scale of 1 to 9, with a score of 1 being very susceptible ranging up to a score of 9 being tolerant. Preliminary scores are reported as double digits, for example &#x2018;55&#x2019; indicates a preliminary score of 5 on the scale of 1 to 9.</p>

      <p id="h-0006" num="0000">Genetic Marker Profile</p>
      <p id="p-0119" num="0118">In addition to phenotypic observations, a plant can also be identified by its genotype. The genotype of a plant can be characterized through a genetic marker profile which can identify plants of the same variety or a related variety, or which can be used to determine or validate a pedigree. Genetic marker profiles can be obtained by techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF), sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) also referred to as microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or genome-wide evaluations such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). For example, see Cregan et al. (1999) &#x201c;An Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean Genome&#x201d; Crop Science 39:1464, and Berry et al. (2003) &#x201c;Assessing Probability of Ancestry Using Simple Sequence Repeat Profiles: Applications to Maize Inbred Lines and Soybean Varieties&#x201d; Genetics 165:331.</p>
      <p id="p-0120" num="0119">Favorable genotypes and or marker profiles, optionally associated with a trait of interest, may be identified by one or more methodologies. In some examples one or more markers are used, including but not limited to AFLPs, RFLPs, ASH, SSRs, SNPs, indels, padlock probes, molecular inversion probes, microarrays, sequencing, and the like. In some methods, a target nucleic acid is amplified prior to hybridization with a probe. In other cases, the target nucleic acid is not amplified prior to hybridization, such as methods using molecular inversion probes (see, for example Hardenbol et al. (2003) Nat Biotech 21:673-678). In some examples, the genotype related to a specific trait is monitored, while in other examples, a genome-wide evaluation including but not limited to one or more of marker panels, library screens, association studies, microarrays, gene chips, expression studies, or sequencing such as whole-genome resequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) may be used. In some examples, no target-specific probe is needed, for example by using sequencing technologies, including but not limited to next-generation sequencing methods (see, for example, Metzker (2010) Nat Rev Genet 11:31-46; and, Egan et al. (2012) Am J Bot 99:175-185) such as sequencing by synthesis (e.g., Roche 454 pyrosequencing, Illumina Genome Analyzer, and Ion Torrent PGM or Proton systems), sequencing by ligation (e.g., SOLiD from Applied Biosystems, and Polnator system from Azco Biotech), and single molecule sequencing (SMS or third-generation sequencing) which eliminate template amplification (e.g., Helicos system, and PacBio RS system from Pacific BioSciences). Further technologies include optical sequencing systems (e.g., Starlight from Life Technologies), and nanopore sequencing (e.g., GridION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Each of these may be coupled with one or more enrichment strategies for organellar or nuclear genomes in order to reduce the complexity of the genome under investigation via PCR, hybridization, restriction enzyme (see, e.g., Elshire et al. (2011) PLoS ONE 6:e19379), and expression methods. In some examples, no reference genome sequence is needed in order to complete the analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-0121" num="0120">Methods are provided of characterizing soybean variety 5PVAM88, or a variety comprising the phenotypic characteristics, morphological characteristics, physiological characteristics or combination thereof of soybean variety 5PVAM88. A method comprising isolating nucleic acids, such as DNA, from a plant, a plant part, plant cell or a seed of the soybean variety disclosed herein is provided. The method can include mechanical, electrical and/or chemical disruption of the plant, plant part, plant cell or seed, contacting the disrupted plant, plant part, plant cell or seed with a buffer or solvent, to produce a solution or suspension comprising nucleic acids, optionally contacting the nucleic acids with a precipiting agent to precipitate the nucleic acids, optionally extracting the nucleic acids, and optionally separating the nucleic acids such as by centrifugation or by binding to beads or a column, with subsequent elution, or a combination thereof. If DNA is being isolated, an RNase can be included in one or more of the method steps. The nucleic acids isolated can comprise all or substantially all of the genomic DNA sequence, all or substantially all of the chromosomal DNA sequence or all or substantially all of the coding sequences (cDNA) of the plant, plant part, or plant cell from which they were isolated. The amount and type of nucleic acids isolated may be sufficient to permit whole genome sequencing of the plant from which they were isolated or chromosomal marker analysis of the plant from which they were isolated.</p>
      <p id="p-0122" num="0121">The methods can be used to produce nucleic acids from the plant, plant part, seed or cell, which nucleic acids can be, for example, analyzed to produce data. The data can be recorded. The nucleic acids from the disrupted cell, the disrupted plant, plant part, plant cell or seed or the nucleic acids following isolation or separation can be contacted with primers and nucleotide bases, and/or a polymerase to facilitate PCR sequencing or marker analysis of the nucleic acids. In some examples, the nucleic acids produced can be sequenced or contacted with markers to produce a genetic profile, a molecular profile, a marker profile, a haplotype, or any combination thereof. In some examples, the genetic profile or nucleotide sequence is recorded on a computer readable medium. In other examples, the methods may further comprise using the nucleic acids produced from plants, plant parts, plant cells or seeds in a plant breeding program, for example in making soybean crossing, selection and/or advancement decisions in a breeding program. Crossing includes any type of plant breeding crossing method, including but not limited to outcrossing, selfing, backcrossing, locus conversion, introgression and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some examples, one or more markers are used to characterize and/or evaluate a soybean variety. Particular markers used for these purposes are not limited to any particular set of markers, but are envisioned to include any type of marker and marker profile which provides a means of distinguishing varieties.

      <p id="p-0124" num="0123">Primers and PCR protocols for assaying these and other markers are disclosed in Soybase (sponsored by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Iowa State University) which is available online. In addition to being used for identification of soybean variety 5PVAM88 and plant parts and plant cells of variety 5PVAM88, the genetic profile may be used to identify a soybean plant produced through the use of 5PVAM88 or to verify a pedigree for progeny plants produced through the use of 5PVAM88. The genetic marker profile is also useful in breeding and developing backcross conversions.</p>
      <p id="p-0125" num="0124">Provided is a soybean plant characterized by molecular and physiological data obtained from the representative sample of said variety deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Thus, plants, seeds, or parts thereof, having all or substantially all of the physiological, morphological, and/or phenotypic characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88 are provided. Further provided is a soybean plant formed by the combination of the disclosed soybean plant or plant cell with another soybean plant or cell and comprising the homozygous alleles of the variety. A soybean plant comprising all of the physiological, morphological and/or phenotypic characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88 can be combined with another soybean plant in a soybean breeding program. In some examples the other soybean plant comprises all of the physiological, morphological and/or phenotypic characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88.</p>
      <p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some examples, a plant, a plant part, or a seed of soybean variety 5PVAM88 is characterized by producing a molecular profile.

A genotypic profile includes but is not limited to a marker profile, such as a genetic map, a linkage map, a trait marker profile, a SNP profile, an SSR profile, a genome-wide marker profile, a haplotype, and the like. A molecular profile may also be a nucleic acid sequence profile, and/or a physical map. A phenotypic profile includes but is not limited to one or more phenotypic traits, a protein expression profile, a metabolic profile, an mRNA expression profile, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-0127" num="0126">Means of performing genetic marker profiles using SSR polymorphisms are well known in the art. A marker system based on SSRs can be highly informative in linkage analysis relative to other marker systems in that multiple alleles may be present. Another advantage of this type of marker is that, through use of flanking primers, detection of SSRs can be achieved, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive Southern hybridization. PCR detection is done using two oligonucleotide primers flanking the polymorphic segment of repetitive DNA to amplify the SSR region.</p>
      <p id="p-0128" num="0127">Following amplification, markers can be scored by electrophoresis of the amplification products. Scoring of marker genotype is based on the size of the amplified fragment, which correlates to the number of base pairs of the fragment. While variation in the primer used or in laboratory procedures can affect the reported fragment size, relative values should remain constant regardless of the specific primer or laboratory used. When comparing varieties it is preferable if all SSR profiles are performed in the same lab.</p>

      <p id="p-0130" num="0129">The SSR profile of soybean plant 5PVAM88 can be used to identify plants comprising 5PVAM88 as a parent, since such plants will comprise the same homozygous alleles as 5PVAM88. Because the soybean variety is essentially homozygous at all relevant loci, most loci should have only one type of allele present. In contrast, a genetic marker profile of an F1 progeny should be the sum of those parents, e.g., if one parent was homozygous for allele X at a particular locus, and the other parent homozygous for allele Y at that locus, then the F1 progeny will be XY (heterozygous) at that locus. Subsequent generations of progeny produced by selection and breeding are expected to be of genotype XX (homozygous), YY (homozygous), or XY (heterozygous) for that locus position. When the F1 plant is selfed or sibbed for successive filial generations, the locus should be either X or Y for that position.</p>
      <p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, plants and plant parts substantially benefiting from the use of 5PVAM88 in their development, such as 5PVAM88 comprising a backcross conversion, transgene, or genetic sterility factor, may be identified by having a molecular marker profile with a high percent identity to 5PVAM88. Such a percent identity might be 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 99.9% identical to 5PVAM88.</p>
      <p id="p-0132" num="0131">The SSR profile of variety 5PVAM88 also can be used to identify essentially derived varieties and other progeny varieties developed from the use of 5PVAM88, as well as cells and other plant parts thereof.

Such plants may be developed, for example, using the markers identified in WO00/31964, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,967 and 7,288,386. Progeny plants and plant parts produced using 5PVAM88 may be identified by having a molecular marker profile of at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% genetic contribution from soybean variety 5PVAM88, as measured by either percent identity or percent similarity. Such progeny may be further characterized as being within a pedigree distance of 5PVAM88, such as within 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or less cross-pollinations to a soybean plant other than 5PVAM88, or a plant that has 5PVAM88 as a progenitor.

A backcross conversion of 5PVAM88 occurs when DNA sequences are introduced through backcrossing with 5PVAM88 utilized as the recurrent parent. Naturally occurring, modified and transgenic DNA sequences may be introduced through backcrossing techniques. A backcross conversion may produce a plant with a trait or locus conversion in at least two or more backcrosses, including at least 2 backcrosses, at least 3 backcrosses, at least 4 backcrosses, at least 5 backcrosses, at least 6 backcrosses or more, depending at least in part on the differences between the parents of the original cross. Molecular marker assisted breeding or selection may be utilized to reduce the number of backcrosses necessary to achieve the backcross conversion.</p>
      <p id="p-0137" num="0136">The complexity of the backcross conversion method depends on the type of trait being transferred (a single gene or closely linked genes compared to unlinked genes), the level of expression of the trait, the type of inheritance (cytoplasmic or nuclear), dominant or recessive trait expression, and the types of parents included in the cross. It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that for single gene traits that are relatively easy to classify, the backcross method is effective and relatively easy to manage. (See Hallauer et al., in Corn and Corn Improvement, Sprague and Dudley, Third Ed. 1998). Desired traits that may be transferred through backcross conversion include, but are not limited to, sterility (nuclear and cytoplasmic), fertility restoration, nutritional enhancements, drought tolerance, nitrogen utilization, altered fatty acid profile, low phytate, industrial enhancements, disease resistance (bacterial, fungal, or viral), insect resistance, and herbicide resistance. In addition, a recombination site itself, such as an FRT site, Lox site, or other site specific integration site, may be inserted by backcrossing and utilized for direct insertion of one or more genes of interest into a specific plant variety. A single locus conversion may contain several transgenes or modifications, such as a transgene or modification for disease resistance and for herbicide resistance. The gene for herbicide resistance may be used as a selectable marker and/or as a phenotypic trait. A single locus conversion of site specific integration system allows for the integration of multiple genes at a known recombination site in the genome. At least one, at least two or at least three and less than ten, less than nine, less than eight, less than seven, less than six, less than five or less than four locus conversions may be introduced into the plant by backcrossing, introgression or transformation to express the desired trait, while the plant, or a plant grown from the seed, plant part or plant cell, otherwise retains the phenotypic characteristics of the deposited seed when grown under the same environmental conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-0138" num="0137">The backcross conversion may result from either the transfer of a dominant allele or a recessive allele. Selection of progeny containing the trait of interest can be accomplished by direct selection for a trait associated with a dominant allele. Transgenes transferred via backcrossing typically function as a dominant single gene trait and are relatively easy to classify. Selection of progeny for a trait that is transferred via a recessive allele requires growing and selfing the first backcross generation to determine which plants carry the recessive alleles. Recessive traits may require additional progeny testing in successive backcross generations to determine the presence of the locus of interest. The last backcross generation is usually selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the trait(s) being transferred, although a backcross conversion with a stably introgressed trait may also be maintained by further backcrossing to the recurrent parent with subsequent selection for the trait.</p>
      <p id="p-0139" num="0138">An example of backcrossing to introduce a trait into a starting variety is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,556. The procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,556 can be summarized as follows: The soybean variety known as Williams '82 [<i>Glycine max </i>L. Merr.] (Reg. No. 222, PI 518671) was developed using backcrossing techniques to transfer a locus comprising the Rps1 gene to the variety Williams (Bernard and Cremeens, 1988, Crop Sci., 28:1027). Williams '82 is a composite of four resistant lines from the BC<sub>6</sub>F<sub>3 </sub>generation, which were selected from 12 field-tested resistant lines from Williams&#xd7;Kingwa. The variety Williams was used as the recurrent parent in the backcross and the variety Kingwa was used as the source of the Rps1 locus. This gene locus confers resistance to 19 of the 24 races of the fungal agent <i>phytophthora </i>root rot. The F1 or F2 seedlings from each backcross round were tested for resistance to the fungus by hypocotyl inoculation using the inoculum of race 5. The final generation was tested using inoculum of races 1 to 9. In a backcross such as this, where the desired characteristic being transferred to the recurrent parent is controlled by a major gene which can be readily evaluated during the backcrossing, it is common to conduct enough backcrosses to avoid testing individual progeny for specific traits such as yield in extensive replicated tests. In general, four or more backcrosses are used when there is no evaluation of the progeny for specific traits, such as yield. As in this example, lines with the phenotype of the recurrent parent may be composited without the usual replicated tests for traits such as yield, protein or oil percentage in the individual lines. The variety Williams '82 is comparable to the recurrent parent variety Williams in its traits except resistance to <i>phytophthora </i>rot. For example, both varieties have a relative maturity of 38, indeterminate stems, white flowers, brown pubescence, tan pods at maturity and shiny yellow seeds with black to light black hila.</p>
      <p id="p-0140" num="0139">Along with selection for the trait of interest, progeny are selected for the phenotype of the recurrent parent. The backcross is a form of inbreeding, and the features of the recurrent parent are recovered after successive backcrosses, such as at least one, at least two, at least three, at least 4 or at least 5 backcrosses. The number of backcrosses necessary can be reduced with the use of molecular markers. Other factors, such as a genetically similar donor parent, may also reduce the number of backcrosses necessary. As noted by Poehlman, backcrossing is easiest for simply inherited, dominant, and easily recognized traits.</p>
      <p id="p-0141" num="0140">One process for adding or modifying a trait or locus in soybean variety 5PVAM88 comprises crossing 5PVAM88 plants grown from 5PVAM88 seed with plants of another soybean variety that comprises a desired trait lacking in 5PVAM88, selecting F1 progeny plants that possess the desired trait or locus to produce selected F1 progeny plants, crossing the selected progeny plants back to 5PVAM88 plants to produce backcross1 (BC1) progeny plants. The BC1F1 progeny plants that have the desired trait and the morphological characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88 are selected and backcrossed to 5PVAM88 to generate BC2F1 progeny plants. Additional backcrossing and selection of progeny plants with the desired trait will produce BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, . . . BCxF1 generations of plants. The backcross populations of 5PVAM88 may be further characterized as having the phenotypic, physiological and/or morphological characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88, such as listed in Table 1, as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions and/or may be characterized by percent similarity or identity to 5PVAM88 as determined by SSR or other molecular markers. The above method may be utilized with fewer backcrosses in appropriate situations, such as when the donor parent is highly related or molecular markers are used in one or more selection steps. Desired traits that may be used include those nucleic acids known in the art, some of which are listed herein, that will affect traits through nucleic acid expression or inhibition. Desired loci also include the introgression of FRT, Lox, and/or other recombination sites for site specific integration. Desired loci further include QTLs, which may also affect a desired trait.</p>
      <p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, the above process and other similar processes described herein may be used to produce first generation progeny soybean seed by adding a step at the end of the process that comprises crossing 5PVAM88 with the introgressed trait or locus with a different soybean plant and harvesting the resultant first generation progeny soybean seed.</p>
      <p id="p-0143" num="0142">Transgenes and transformation methods provide means to engineer the genome of plants to contain and express heterologous genetic elements, including but not limited to foreign genetic elements, additional copies of endogenous elements, and/or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements, in order to alter at least one trait of a plant in a specific manner. Any heterologous DNA sequence(s), whether from a different species or from the same species, which are inserted into the genome using transformation, backcrossing, or other methods known to one of skill in the art are referred to herein collectively as transgenes. The sequences are heterologous based on sequence source, location of integration, operably linked elements, or any combination thereof. One or more transgenes of interest can be introduced into soybean variety 5PVAM88. Transgenic variants of soybean variety 5PVAM88 plants, seeds, cells, and parts thereof or derived therefrom are provided. Transgenic variants of 5PVAM88 comprise the physiological and morphological characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88, such as listed in Table 1 as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions, and/or may be characterized or identified by percent similarity or identity to 5PVAM88 as determined by SSR or other molecular markers. In some examples, transgenic variants of soybean variety 5PVAM88 are produced by introducing at least one transgene of interest into soybean variety 5PVAM88 by transforming 5PVAM88 with a polynucleotide comprising the transgene of interest. In other examples, transgenic variants of soybean variety 5PVAM88 are produced by introducing at least one transgene by introgressing the transgene into soybean variety 5PVAM88 by crossing.</p>
      <p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one example, a process for modifying soybean variety 5PVAM88 with the addition of a desired trait, said process comprising transforming a soybean plant of variety 5PVAM88 with a transgene that confers a desired trait is provided. Therefore, transgenic 5PVAM88 soybean cells, plants, plant parts, and seeds produced from this process are provided. In some examples one more desired traits may include traits such as herbicide resistance, insect resistance, disease resistance, decreased phytate, modified fatty acid profile, modified fatty acid content, carbohydrate metabolism, protein content, or oil content. The specific gene may be any known in the art or listed herein, including but not limited to a polynucleotide conferring resistance to an ALS-inhibitor herbicide, imidazolinone, sulfonylurea, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitors, hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors, glyphosate, glufosinate, triazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, broxynil, metribuzin, or benzonitrile herbicides; a polynucleotide encoding a <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>polypeptide, a polynucleotide encoding a phytase, a fatty acid desaturase (e.g., FAD-2, FAD-3), galactinol synthase, a raffinose synthetic enzyme; or a polynucleotide conferring resistance to soybean cyst nematode, brown stem rot, <i>Phytophthora </i>root rot, soybean mosaic virus, sudden death syndrome, or other plant pathogen.</p>
      <p id="p-0145" num="0144">Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., &#x201c;Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants&#x201d; in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88; and Armstrong (1999) &#x201c;The First Decade of Maize Transformation: A Review and Future Perspective&#x201d; Maydica 44:101-109. In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber et al., &#x201c;Vectors for Plant Transformation&#x201d; in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119.</p>
      <p id="p-0146" num="0145">In general, methods to transform, modify, edit or alter plant endogenous genomic DNA include altering the plant native DNA sequence or a pre-existing transgenic sequence including regulatory elements, coding and non-coding sequences. These methods can be used, for example, to target nucleic acids to pre-engineered target recognition sequences in the genome. Such pre-engineered target sequences may be introduced by genome editing or modification. As an example, a genetically modified plant variety is generated using &#x201c;custom&#x201d; or engineered endonucleases such as meganucleases produced to modify plant genomes (see e.g., WO 2009/114321; Gao et al. (2010) Plant Journal 1:176-187). Another site-directed engineering method is through the use of zinc finger domain recognition coupled with the restriction properties of restriction enzyme. See e.g., Urnov, et al., (2010) Nat Rev Genet. 11(9):636-46; Shukla, et al., (2009) Nature 459 (7245):437-41. A transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-DNA modifying enzyme (TALE or TALEN) is also used to engineer changes in plant genome. See e.g., US20110145940, Cermak et al., (2011) Nucleic Acids Res. 39(12) and Boch et al., (2009), Science 326(5959): 1509-12. Site-specific modification of plant genomes can also be performed using the bacterial type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. See e.g., Belhaj et al., (2013), Plant Methods 9: 39; The Cas9/guide RNA-based system allows targeted cleavage of genomic DNA guided by a customizable small noncoding RNA in plants (see e.g., WO 2015026883A1).</p>
      <p id="p-0147" num="0146">The modified variety 5PVAM88 or a plant otherwise derived from variety 5PVAM88 may be further characterized as having all or essentially all of the phenotypic characteristics, or all or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of variety 5PVAM88, and/or may be characterized by percent identity to 5PVAM88 as determined by molecular markers, such as SSR markers or SNP markers. By essentially all of the phenotypic characteristics or morphological and physiological characteristics, it is meant that all of the characteristics of a plant are recovered that are otherwise present when compared in the same environment, other than an occasional variant trait that might arise during backcrossing or direct introduction of a transgene or specific genetic modification.</p>
      <p id="p-0148" num="0147">Plant transformation methods may involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector or recombinant construct comprises a DNA sequence that contains a coding sequence, such as a protein and/or RNA coding sequence under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector or construct may contain one or more coding sequences and one or more regulatory elements.</p>
      <p id="p-0149" num="0148">A genetic trait which has been engineered into the genome of a particular soybean plant may then be moved into the genome of another variety using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach is commonly used to move a transgene from a transformed soybean variety into an elite soybean variety, and the resulting backcross conversion plant would then contain the transgene(s).</p>
      <p id="p-0150" num="0149">Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include, but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-0151" num="0150">A genetic map can be generated that identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule, for example via conventional restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, simple sequence repeats (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, pp. 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993).</p>
      <p id="p-0152" num="0151">Wang et al. discuss &#x201c;Large Scale Identification, Mapping and Genotyping of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Human Genome&#x201d;, Science (1998) 280:1077-1082, and similar capabilities are increasingly available for the soybean genome. Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons could involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR, sequencing or combinations thereof, all of which are conventional techniques. SNPs may also be used alone or in combination with other techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-0153" num="0152">Likewise, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Through the transformation of soybean the expression of genes can be altered to enhance disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide resistance, agronomic, grain quality, and other traits. Transformation can also be used to insert DNA sequences which control or help control male-sterility. DNA sequences native to soybean as well as non-native DNA sequences can be transformed into soybean and used to alter levels of native or non-native proteins. Various promoters, targeting sequences, enhancing sequences, and other DNA sequences can be inserted into the genome for the purpose of altering the expression of proteins. Reduction of the activity of specific genes (also known as gene silencing or gene suppression) is desirable for several aspects of genetic engineering in plants.</p>
      <p id="p-0154" num="0153">Many techniques for gene silencing are well known to one of skill in the art, including but not limited to, knock-outs (such as by insertion of a transposable element such as mu (Vicki Chandler, <i>The Maize Handbook </i>Ch. 118 (Springer-Verlag 1994)); antisense technology (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,107,065; 5,453,566; and 5,759,829); co-suppression (e.g., Taylor (1997) Plant Cell 9:1245; Jorgensen (1990) Trends Biotech 8:340-344; Flavell (1994) PNAS USA 91:3490-3496; Finnegan et al.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describe a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not &#x201c;on&#x201d; resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning &#x201c;on&#x201d;, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene conferring male fertility to be transcribed.

Nos. 5,437,697, 7,973,212, and US2011/0258733, and US2011/0283425 may be utilized by a breeder of ordinary skill in the art to identify genetic loci that are associated with yield potential to further purify the variety in order to increase its yield. A breeder of ordinary skill in the art may fix agronomically relevant loci by making them homozygous in order to optimize the performance of the variety. The development of soybean sublines and the use of accelerated yield technology is a plant breeding technique.</p>
      <p id="p-0207" num="0206">Soybean varieties such as 5PVAM88 are typically developed for use in seed and grain production. However, soybean varieties such as 5PVAM88 also provide a source of breeding material that may be used to develop new soybean varieties. Plant breeding techniques known in the art and used in a soybean plant breeding program include, but are not limited to, recurrent selection, mass selection, bulk selection, backcrossing, pedigree breeding, open pollination breeding, restriction fragment length polymorphism enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection, making double haploids, and transformation. Often combinations of these techniques are used. The development of soybean varieties in a plant breeding program requires, in general, the development and evaluation of homozygous varieties. There are many analytical methods available to evaluate a new variety. The oldest and most traditional method of analysis is the observation of phenotypic traits but genotypic analysis may also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-0208" num="0207">Methods for producing a soybean plant by crossing a first parent soybean plant with a second parent soybean plant wherein the first and/or second parent soybean plant is variety 5PVAM88 are provided. Also provided are methods for producing a soybean plant having substantially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of variety 5PVAM88, by crossing a first parent soybean plant with a second parent soybean plant wherein the first and/or the second parent soybean plant is a plant having substantially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of variety 5PVAM88 set forth in Table 1, as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions. The other parent may be any soybean plant, such as a soybean plant that is part of a synthetic or natural population. Any such methods using soybean variety 5PVAM88 include but are not limited to selfing, sibbing, backcrossing, mass selection, pedigree breeding, bulk selection, hybrid production, crossing to populations, and the like. These methods are well known in the art and some of the more commonly used breeding methods are described below.</p>
      <p id="p-0209" num="0208">Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, such as 5PVAM88 or a soybean variety having all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of 5PVAM88, and another soybean variety having one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking or which complements 5PVAM88. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population. In the pedigree method, superior plants are selfed and selected in successive filial generations. In the succeeding filial generations, the heterozygous allele condition gives way to the homozygous allele condition as a result of inbreeding. Typically in the pedigree method of breeding, five or more successive filial generations of selfing and selection are practiced: e.g., F1&#x2192;F2; F2&#x2192;F3; F3&#x2192;F4; F4&#x2192;F5; etc. In some examples, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more generations of selfing and selection are practiced. After a sufficient amount of inbreeding, successive filial generations will serve to increase seed of the developed variety. Typically, the developed variety comprises homozygous alleles at about 95% or more of its loci.</p>
      <p id="p-0210" num="0209">In addition to being used to create backcross conversion populations, backcrossing can also be used in combination with pedigree breeding. As discussed previously, backcrossing can be used to transfer one or more specifically desirable traits from one variety (the donor parent) to a developed variety (the recurrent parent), which has good overall agronomic characteristics yet may lack one or more other desirable traits. However, the same procedure can be used to move the progeny toward the genotype of the recurrent parent but at the same time retain many components of the non-recurrent parent by stopping the backcrossing at an early stage and proceeding with selfing and selection. For example, a soybean variety may be crossed with another variety to produce a first generation progeny plant. The first generation progeny plant may then be backcrossed to one of its parent varieties to create a BC1F1. Progeny are selfed and selected so that the newly developed variety has many of the attributes of the recurrent parent and yet several of the desired attributes of the donor parent. This approach leverages the value and strengths of both parents for use in new soybean varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-0211" num="0210">Therefore, in some examples a method of making a backcross conversion of soybean variety 5PVAM88, comprising the steps of crossing a plant of soybean variety 5PVAM88 or a soybean variety having all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of 5PVAM88 with a donor plant possessing a desired trait to introduce the desired trait, selecting an F1 progeny plant containing the desired trait, and backcrossing the selected F1 progeny plant to a plant of soybean variety 5PVAM88 are provided. This method may further comprise the step of obtaining a molecular marker profile of soybean variety 5PVAM88 and using the molecular marker profile to select for a progeny plant with the desired trait and the molecular marker profile of 5PVAM88. The molecular marker profile can comprise information from one or more markers. In one example the desired trait is a mutant gene or transgene present in the donor parent. In another example, the desired trait is a native trait in the donor parent.</p>
      <p id="p-0212" num="0211">Recurrent selection is a method used in a plant breeding program to improve a population of plants. Variety 5PVAM88, and/or a soybean variety having all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of 5PVAM88, is suitable for use in a recurrent selection program. The method entails individual plants cross pollinating with each other to form progeny. The progeny are grown and the superior progeny selected by any number of selection methods, which include individual plant, half-sib progeny, full-sib progeny, and selfed progeny. The selected progeny are cross pollinated with each other to form progeny for another population. This population is planted and, again, superior plants are selected to cross pollinate with each other. Recurrent selection is a cyclical process and therefore can be repeated as many times as desired. The objective of recurrent selection is to improve the traits of a population. The improved population can then be used as a source of breeding material to obtain new varieties for commercial or breeding use, including the production of a synthetic cultivar. A synthetic cultivar is the resultant progeny formed by the intercrossing of several selected varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-0213" num="0212">Mass selection is a useful technique when used in conjunction with molecular marker enhanced selection. In mass selection, seeds from individuals are selected based on phenotype or genotype. These selected seeds are then bulked and used to grow the next generation. Bulk selection requires growing a population of plants in a bulk plot, allowing the plants to self-pollinate, harvesting the seed in bulk, and then using a sample of the seed harvested in bulk to plant the next generation. Also, instead of self pollination, directed pollination could be used as part of the breeding program.</p>
      <p id="p-0214" num="0213">Mutation breeding is another method of introducing new traits into soybean variety 5PVAM88 or a soybean variety having all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of 5PVAM88. Mutations that occur spontaneously or that are artificially induced can be useful sources of variability for a plant breeder. The goal of artificial mutagenesis is to increase the rate of mutation for a desired characteristic. Mutation rates can be increased by many different means including temperature, long-term seed storage, tissue culture conditions, radiation; such as X-rays, gamma rays (e.g., cobalt 60 or cesium 137), neutrons, (product of nuclear fission by uranium 235 in an atomic reactor), beta radiation (emitted from radioisotopes such as phosphorus 32 or carbon 14), ultraviolet radiation (preferably from 2500 to 2900 nm), or chemical mutagens such as base analogues (5-bromo-uracil), related compounds (8-ethoxy caffeine), antibiotics (streptonigrin), alkylating agents (sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, epoxides, ethylenamines, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfones, lactones), azide, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, or acridines. Once a desired trait is observed through mutagenesis, the trait may then be incorporated into existing germplasm by traditional breeding techniques. Details of mutation breeding can be found in &#x201c;Principles of Cultivar Development&#x201d; Fehr, 1993, Macmillan Publishing Company. In addition, mutations created in other soybean plants may be used to produce a backcross conversion of 5PVAM88 that comprises such mutation.</p>
      <p id="p-0215" num="0214">Molecular markers, which include markers identified through the use of techniques such as isozyme electrophoresis, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF), sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and sequencing may be used in plant breeding methods utilizing 5PVAM88.</p>
      <p id="p-0216" num="0215">Isozyme electrophoresis and RFLPs have been widely used to determine genetic composition. Shoemaker &#x26; Olsen (&#x201c;Molecular Linkage Map of Soybean (<i>Glycine max </i>L. Merr.)&#x201d;, p. 6.131-6.138, in S. J. O'Brien (ed.) Genetic Maps: Locus Maps of Complex Genomes. (1993) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), developed a molecular genetic linkage map that consisted of 25 linkage groups with about 365 RFLP, 11 RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA), three classical markers, and four isozyme loci. See also, Shoemaker &#x201c;RFLP Map of Soybean&#x201d; pp 299-309 (1994), in R. L. Phillips and I. K. Vasil (ed.) describing DNA-based markers in plants. Kluwer Academic Press Dordrecht, the Netherlands.</p>
      <p id="p-0217" num="0216">SSR technology is an efficient and practical marker technology; more marker loci can be routinely used and more alleles per marker locus can be found using SSRs in comparison to RFLPs. For example, Diwan and Cregan, described highly polymorphic microsatellite loci in soybean with as many as 26 alleles (Diwan and Cregan (1997) Theor Appl Genet 95:220-225). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may also be used to identify the unique genetic composition of 5PVAM88 and progeny varieties retaining or derived from that unique genetic composition. Various molecular marker techniques may be used in combination to enhance overall resolution.</p>
      <p id="p-0218" num="0217">Soybean DNA molecular marker linkage maps have been rapidly constructed and widely implemented in genetic studies. One such study is described in Cregan et al. (1999) Crop Sci 39:1464-1490. Sequences and PCR conditions of SSR loci in soybean, as well as the most current genetic map, may be found in the Soybase database available online.</p>
      <p id="p-0219" num="0218">One use of molecular markers is quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. QTL mapping is the use of markers which are known to be closely linked to alleles that have measurable effects on a quantitative trait. Selection in the breeding process is based upon the accumulation of markers linked to the positive effecting alleles and/or the elimination of the markers linked to the negative effecting alleles from the plant genome.</p>
      <p id="p-0220" num="0219">Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select for the genome of the recurrent parent and against the genome of the donor parent. Using this procedure can minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program. The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called genetic marker enhanced selection.</p>
      <p id="h-0014" num="0000">Production of Double Haploids</p>
      <p id="p-0221" num="0220">The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of plants with a homozygous phenotype in the breeding program. For example, a soybean plant for which variety 5PVAM88 or a soybean variety having all of the phenotypic, morphological and/or physiological characteristics of 5PVAM88 is a parent can be used to produce double haploid plants. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes (1N) from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. For example, see US Patent Publication No. 2003/0005479. This can be advantageous because the process omits the generations of selfing needed to obtain a homozygous plant from a heterozygous source. Double haploid technology in soybean is discussed in Croser et al. (2006) Crit Rev Plant Sci 25:139-157; and Rodrigues et al. (2006) Brazilian Arc Biol Tech 49:537-545.</p>
      <p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some examples a process for making a substantially homozygous 5PVAM88 progeny plant by producing or obtaining a seed from the cross of 5PVAM88 and another soybean plant and applying double haploid methods to the F1 seed or F1 plant or to any successive filial generation is provided. Based on studies in maize, and currently being conducted in soybean, such methods would decrease the number of generations required to produce a variety with similar genetics or characteristics to 5PVAM88. See Bernardo &#x26; Kahler (2001) Theor Appl Genet 102:986-992.</p>
      <p id="p-0223" num="0222">In particular, a process of making seed retaining the molecular marker profile of soybean variety 5PVAM88 is contemplated, such process comprising obtaining or producing F1 seed for which soybean variety 5PVAM88 is a parent, inducing doubled haploids to create progeny without the occurrence of meiotic segregation, obtaining the molecular marker profile of soybean variety 5PVAM88, and selecting progeny that retain the molecular marker profile of 5PVAM88.</p>
      <p id="p-0224" num="0223">Methods using seeds, plants, cells, or plant parts of variety 5PVAM88 in tissue culture are provided, as are the cultures, plants, parts, cells, and/or seeds derived therefrom. Tissue culture of various tissues of soybeans and regeneration of plants therefrom is well known and widely published. For example, see Komatsuda et al. (1991) Crop Sci 31:333-337; Stephens et al. &#x201c;Agronomic Evaluation of Tissue-Culture-Derived Soybean Plants&#x201d; (1991) Theor Appl Genet 82:633-635; Komatsuda et al. &#x201c;Maturation and Germination of Somatic Embryos as Affected by Sucrose and Plant Growth Regulators in Soybeans <i>Glycine gracilis </i>Skvortz and <i>Glycine max </i>(L.) Merr.&#x201d; (1992) Plant Cell Tissue and Organ Culture 28:103-113; Dhir et al. &#x201c;Regeneration of Fertile Plants from Protoplasts of Soybean (<i>Glycine max </i>L. Merr.): Genotypic Differences in Culture Response&#x201d; (1992) Plant Cell Rep 11:285-289; Pandey et al. &#x201c;Plant Regeneration from Leaf and Hypocotyl Explants of <i>Glycine wightii </i>(W. and A.)

Nos. 5,024,944 and 5,008,200. Thus, another aspect is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce soybean plants having the physiological and morphological characteristics of soybean variety 5PVAM88.</p>
      <p id="p-0225" num="0224">Soybean seeds, plants, and plant parts of variety 5PVAM88 may be cleaned and/or treated. Provided are methods for producing treated seed comprising treating a seed described herein. Provided are methods for producing cleaned seed comprising cleaning a seed or a population or plurality of seeds described herein. The resulting seeds, plants, or plant parts produced by the cleaning and/or treating process(es) may exhibit enhanced yield characteristics. Enhanced yield characteristics can include one or more of the following: increased germination efficiency under normal and/or stress conditions, improved plant physiology, growth and/or development, such as water use efficiency, water retention efficiency, improved nitrogen use, enhanced carbon assimilation, improved photosynthesis, and accelerated maturation, and improved disease and/or pathogen tolerance. Yield characteristics can furthermore include enhanced plant architecture (under stress and non-stress conditions), including but not limited to early flowering, flowering control for hybrid seed production, seedling vigor, plant size, internode number and distance, root growth, seed size, fruit size, pod size, pod or ear number, seed number per pod or ear, seed mass, enhanced seed filling, reduced seed dispersal, reduced pod dehiscence and lodging resistance. Further yield characteristics include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and composition, nutritional value, reduction in anti-nutritional compounds, improved processability, and better storage stability.</p>
      <p id="p-0226" num="0225">Cleaning a seed or seed cleaning refers to the removal of impurities and debris material from the harvested seed. Material to be removed from the seed includes but is not limited to soil, and plant waste, chaff, pebbles, weed seeds, broken soybean seeds, fungi, bacteria, insect material, including insect eggs, larvae, and parts thereof, and any other pests that exist with the harvested crop. The terms cleaning a seed or seed cleaning also refer to the removal of any debris or impurities such as low quality, infested, or infected seeds and seeds of different species that are foreign to the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-0227" num="0226">Treating a seed or applying a treatment to a seed refers to the application of a composition to a seed as a coating or otherwise. The method can include a step of contacting the seed with a composition to coat the surface of the seed or to adhere the composition to the seed. The composition may be applied to the seed in a seed treatment at any time from harvesting of the seed to sowing of the seed. The composition may be applied using methods including but not limited to mixing in a container, mechanical application, tumbling, spraying, misting, and immersion. Thus, the composition may be applied as a powder, a crystalline, a ready-to-use, a slurry, a mist, and/or a soak. For a general discussion of techniques used to apply fungicides to seeds, see &#x201c;Seed Treatment,&#x201d; 2d ed., (1986), edited by K. A Jeffs (chapter 9). The composition to be used as a seed treatment can comprise one or more of a pesticide, a fungicide, an insecticide, a nematicide, an antimicrobial, an inoculant, a growth promoter, a polymer, a flow agent, a coating, or any combination thereof. General classes or family of seed treatment agents include triazoles, anilides, pyrazoles, carboxamides, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI), triazolinthiones, strobilurins, amides, and anthranilic diamides. In some examples, the seed treatment comprises trifloxystrobin, azoxystrobin, metalaxyl, metalaxyl-m, mefenoxam, fludioxinil, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, thiabendazole, ipconazole, penflufen, sedaxane, prothioconazole, picoxystrobin, penthiopyrad, pyraclastrobin, xemium, <i>Rhizobia </i>spp., <i>Bradyrhizobium </i>spp. (e.g., <i>B. japonicum</i>),         <i>Bacillus </i>spp. (e.g., <i>B. firmus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis</i>), lipo-chitooligosaccharide, clothianidin, cyazapyr, rynaxapyr, abamectin, and any combination thereof. In some examples the seed treatment comprises trifloxystrobin, metalaxyl, imidacloprid, <i>Bacillus </i>spp., and any combination thereof. In some examples the seed treatment comprises picoxystrobin, penthiopyrad, cyazapyr, ranaxapyr, and any combination thereof. In some examples, the seed treatment improves seed germination under normal and/or stress environments, early stand count, vigor, yield, root formation, nodulation, and any combination thereof. In some examples seed treatment reduces seed dust levels, insect damage, pathogen establishment and/or damage, plant virus infection and/or damage, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-0228" num="0227">Soybean seeds, plants, and plant parts of variety 5PVAM88 may be used or processed for food, animal feed, or a raw material(s) for industry. Seeds from variety 5PVAM88 can be crushed, or a component of the seeds can be extracted in order to make a plant product, such as protein concentrate, protein isolate, soybean hulls, meal, flour, or oil for a food or feed product. Methods of producing a plant product or a commodity product, such as protein concentrate, protein isolate, soybean hulls, meal, flour, or oil for a food or feed product by processing the plants, plant parts or grain disclosed herein are provided. Also provided are the protein concentrate, protein isolate, soybean hulls, meal, flour, or oil produced by the methods.</p>
      <p id="p-0229" num="0228">Soybean is also used as a food source for both animals and humans. Soybean is widely used as a source of protein for animal feeds for poultry, swine, and cattle, or specialty pet foods. For human consumption soybean meal is made into soybean flour which is processed to protein concentrates used for meat extenders. Production of edible protein ingredients from soybean offers a healthy, less expensive replacement for animal protein in meats and dairy products. During processing of whole soybeans, the fibrous hull is removed and the oil is extracted. The remaining soybean meal is a combination of carbohydrates and approximately 50% protein.</p>
      <p id="p-0230" num="0229">Oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil has a typical composition of 11% palmitic, 4% stearic, 25% oleic, 50% linoleic, and 9% linolenic fatty acid content. Fatty acid composition can be altered, for example, through transformation, breeding or a combination thereof, for improved oxidative stability and nutrition. For example, oleic acid can be raised to at least 70% or 75% of the total fatty acid content, and linolenic acid can be reduced to less than 5% or 3% of the total fatty acid content. Oil with 3% or less linolenic acid is classified as low linolenic oil, oil with less than 1% linolenic acid is classified as ultra-low linolenic oil. Oil with 70% or higher of oleic acid is classified as high oleic oil.</p>
      <p id="p-0231" num="0230">Industrial uses of soybean oil, which is typically subjected to further processing, include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, lubricants, and biodiesel fuel. Soybean oil may be split, inter-esterified, sulfurized, epoxidized, polymerized, ethoxylated, or cleaved. To produce oil, the harvested soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, rolled into flakes, and then the oil is solvent-extracted. The oil extract is refined, optionally blended and/or hydrogenated. The mixture of triglycerides can be split and separated into pure fatty acids, which can be combined with petroleum-derived alcohols or acids, nitrogen, sulfonates, chlorine, or with fatty alcohols derived from fats and oils.</p>
      <p id="p-0232" num="0231">Soybeans are also used as a food source for both animals and humans. Soybeans are widely used as a source of protein for animal feed. The fibrous hull is removed from whole soybean and the oil is extracted. The remaining meal is a combination of carbohydrates and approximately 50% protein. This remaining meal is heat treated under well-established conditions and ground in a hammer mill. Soybean is a predominant source for livestock feed components.</p>
      <p id="p-0233" num="0232">In addition to soybean meal, soybean can be used to produce soy flour. Soy flour refers to defatted soybeans where special care was taken during desolventizing to minimize protein denaturation and to retain a high nitrogen solubility index (NSI) in making the flour. Soy flour is the typical starting material for production of soy concentrate and soy protein isolate. Defatted soy flour is obtained from solvent extracted flakes, and contains less than 1% oil. Full-fat soy flour is made from whole beans and contains about 18% to 20% oil. Low-fat soy flour is made by adding back some oil to defatted soy flour. The lipid content varies, but is usually between 4.5-9%. High-fat soy flour can also be produced by adding soybean oil to defatted flour at the level of 15%. Lecithinated soy flour is made by adding soybean lecithin to defatted, low-fat or high-fat soy flours to increase dispersibility and impart emulsifying properties.</p>
      <p id="p-0234" num="0233">For human consumption, soybean can be used to produce edible ingredients which serve as an alternative source of dietary protein. Common examples include milk, cheese, and meat substitutes. Additionally, soybean can be used to produce various types of fillers for meat and poultry products. Vitamins and/or minerals may be added to make soy products nutritionally more equivalent to animal protein sources as the protein quality is already roughly equivalent.</p>

      <p id="p-0240" num="0239">Soybean variety 5PVAM88 has shown uniformity and stability for all traits, as described in the following variety description information. Soybean variety 5PVAM88 was developed from a cross of XB31AB14 with a version of 93Y83 comprising glufosinate resistance. Variety 5PVAM88 was developed using the method described in Table 2. It has been self-pollinated a sufficient number of generations, with careful attention to uniformity of plant type to ensure a sufficient level of homozygosity and phenotypic stability. The variety has been increased with continued observation for uniformity. No variant traits have been observed or are expected.</p>
